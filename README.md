# How to Build and Deploy a RAG Model from Scratch

The goal of this project is to build a simple RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model and deploy it. To begin, let's start out with some definitions to better understand the principles behind RAG models as well as some of the foundational architecture we will use to quickly deploy it. We will use Docker to make it easy to deploy in any environment, OpenSearch for storing external data, and Streamlit to interact with the model. 

Note that the majority of the code used in this project as well as the documentation for this README was generated using [ChatGPT 4o](https://chatgpt.com/).

## Prompt Engineering
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></p>

<details>

<summary><b>Prompt engineering</b> is the process of designing and optimizing prompts (input text or queries) given to AI models (like GPT-3, GPT-4, or other LLMs) to achieve a specific, desired response.</summary>
It involves crafting questions, statements, or instructions in ways that guide the model to produce responses that are relevant, accurate, and useful for a given task.

### Key Aspects of Prompt Engineering

1. **Input Structuring**: Crafting the input to clearly specify what the model should do. For example, a prompt could be framed as a question, a command, or a set of instructions.
   - **Example**: For a model trained to generate code, a prompt like "Write a Python function to reverse a list" would be more effective than simply saying "Python list."

2. **Context Setting**: Providing context within the prompt helps the model better understand the background or constraints.
   - **Example**: If you need a model to generate text in a particular tone or style, adding context like "Write a motivational message for a tech startup founder" will guide the output's tone.

3. **Iterative Refinement**: Often, the first prompt does not yield the best response. Prompt engineering involves refining and experimenting with prompts iteratively to improve the quality and accuracy of responses.
   - **Example**: Testing variations like "Explain X to a beginner," "Summarize X in one sentence," or "List the pros and cons of X."

4. **Using Instructions and Constraints**: Setting explicit instructions or constraints within the prompt can help in obtaining more structured and specific responses.
   - **Example**: Asking, "List three reasons why renewable energy is important" will likely yield a more concise answer than an open-ended question like "Why is renewable energy important?"

5. **Chaining Prompts**: Breaking down a complex task into multiple smaller prompts, each handling a part of the task, can make responses more accurate. This is known as "prompt chaining."
   - **Example**: For a multi-step task like "Provide a summary, then list key takeaways," chaining prompts helps maintain structure.

6. **Meta-Prompts**: Prompts that explicitly tell the model how to act or think, sometimes even with simulated reasoning steps.
   - **Example**: "Think through each step logically before answering the question."

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></p>

<details>

<summary><b>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</b> is a method used in natural language processing that combines <i>retrieval</i> of relevant information with <i>generation</i> of natural language responses.</summary> It enables large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, contextually relevant, and informed answers by incorporating external knowledge into the response process. RAG is particularly valuable in applications where the model needs to generate responses based on a large knowledge base or document set, such as in customer service, question answering, and summarization tasks.

### Key Components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation

1. **Retriever**:
   - The retriever is responsible for finding relevant information from a large dataset or document store. This step usually involves using a search mechanism or embeddings-based similarity to fetch the most relevant documents, paragraphs, or text snippets.
   - For example, if a user asks a question, the retriever will search through a database of documents to find those that likely contain answers to that question.

2. **Generator**:
   - The generator is typically a large language model (like GPT-3, GPT-4, or other open-source models) that generates responses based on the information retrieved.
   - The retrieved information is combined with the user’s input prompt and fed to the generator, which synthesizes a cohesive response using this enriched context.

### How RAG Works

The basic workflow of a RAG system is as follows:

1. **User Query**: A user submits a question or prompt.
2. **Retrieval Step**: The retriever searches a database or knowledge base to find relevant documents or snippets that may contain information relevant to the question.
3. **Prompt Engineering**: The retrieved information and the original query are combined into a well-structured prompt to help the generator produce an accurate and context-rich answer.
4. **Generation Step**: The generator takes the prompt with the retrieved information and generates a response, synthesizing the information from the documents to create a comprehensive answer.
5. **Response Output**: The final output is presented to the user as an answer that is both generated by the model and informed by the knowledge base.

## Docker
<p align="right"><a href="#top">Go to top</a></p>

<details>

<summary><b>Docker</b> is an open-source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications inside lightweight, portable containers.</summary> These containers bundle everything needed to run an application, including the code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies, making it easier to develop, ship, and run applications consistently across different environments.

### Key Concepts in Docker

1. **Containers**:
   - Containers are lightweight, standalone executable packages that contain all the components necessary to run a piece of software, including the code, libraries, and system tools.
   - Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host operating system’s kernel, making them more resource-efficient and faster to start.

2. **Docker Images**:
   - An image is a blueprint for a container and contains the application code, dependencies, and the runtime environment. It’s a static, read-only file that forms the foundation for a Docker container.
   - Images are built from a `Dockerfile` (a script containing instructions to assemble the image) and can be stored in a registry like Docker Hub.

3. **Dockerfile**:
   - A Dockerfile is a text file that contains commands to assemble an image. It specifies the operating system, dependencies, and other setup steps needed to create a customized image for the application.

4. **Docker Hub and Registries**:
   - Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service for finding and sharing Docker images. Developers can pull pre-built images from Docker Hub or push their own images for others to use.

5. **Docker Compose**:
   - Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services, making it easy to manage complex applications with multiple services (e.g., a web server and a database).

### How Docker Works

- **Building**: Docker builds images from Dockerfiles. A developer writes a Dockerfile with instructions for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, and copying application code.
- **Running**: Once the image is built, a container can be created and run from the image. The container isolates the application from the host, ensuring consistent performance regardless of where it’s running.
- **Portability**: Since Docker packages applications and dependencies into a single container, they can run consistently across any system that supports Docker, whether it’s a developer’s laptop, a testing server, or a production environment in the cloud.

### Why Docker is Useful

1. **Environment Consistency**: Docker ensures that applications run the same way across different environments, reducing “it works on my machine” issues.
2. **Isolation**: Each container is isolated from others, enabling multiple containers to run different applications on the same host without conflicts.
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Docker containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel, so they use less memory and storage than traditional virtual machines.
4. **Scalability**: Docker containers can be scaled easily across distributed systems, making them well-suited for microservices architectures.
5. **Developer Productivity**: Docker accelerates the development workflow by enabling rapid deployment and testing, faster code updates, and improved collaboration.
